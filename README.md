## Requirements

## Write an asynchronous function and call it with async/await : getRandomNumber.js
- Write function called getRandomNumber that returns a promise
- In the promise, write a setTimeout() that will resolve the promise with a random number after .5 seconds
- Write an async function that invokes the getRandomNumber function, awaiting the random number, and printing that to the console.
- Invoke your async function

## Fetch remote data using async/await : remoteData.js
- Write an asynchronous function that accepts 1 parameter
- A city name
- When invoked, this function should use geocode.xyz's API retrieve the city data, which uses a URL formatted as follows:

    https://geocode.xyz/seattle?json=1

- Once retrieved, print to the console the latitude and longitude
- Invoke your async function with a few cities as a test

`src` folder contains all of the answers, as well as an html to test the javascript.
